# Placeholder credentials secret for local-volume-provider NFS plugin
#
# The local-volume-provider plugin uses Kubernetes volume mounts directly
# and does not require cloud provider credentials like S3/Azure/GCP backends.
# However, OADP requires a credential secret to be present for reconciliation.
#
# This secret contains an empty 'cloud' key to satisfy the OADP requirement
# while allowing the NFS-based backups to function without actual credentials.
#
# See: https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator/issues/420
