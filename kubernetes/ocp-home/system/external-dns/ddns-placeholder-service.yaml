## Placeholder service for DDNS ingress backends
##
## The DDNS CronJob creates ingresses that are used solely as metadata carriers
## for external-dns to create Cloudflare DNS records. These ingresses require
## a backend service to satisfy OpenShift's ingress validation, but the service
## itself is never used for actual traffic routing.
